This model uses a small GT2 belt as a toothed rack to move the blobifier's tray back and forth. 
To make room for a stepper motor, the blobifier assembly is risen by 2mm. This should not be an issue on most setups, but depending how your bottom panel sits, it might collide with the skake arm. To solve this, a redesigned shaker arm is provided.


# BOM

To build this, you will need to have the standard components for a blobifier and a few more:

 * 2x M3 FHCS 6mm
 * 3x M3 BHCS or SHCS 8mm
 * Nema17 Stepper motor, pancake recommended
 * GT2 Timing belt, 37 teeth, open
 * GT2 20T Pulley with 5mm bore


If you do not have the required components for a regular blobifier, to build a minimal setup (tray and bucket) you will also need:

 * 2x M3 T-nut
 * 3x M3 SHCS or BHCS 8mm
 * 3x M3 FHCS 8mm (or 6mm also works)
 * 3x M3 heat set inserts
 * 1x 10x15 aluminium strip (if you have the 'newer' 10x30, you can cut it easily)




# Printed parts

You will need to print the following parts:
 * StepperHousing - This is the main blobifier body. It replaces both the base and the mount from the original project. 
 * Tray - the model is designed around the 10x15 old version. The tray has been modified to bolt down to the movement system using two flush screws.
 * BeltCarrier and Tensioner - we wrap the belt around this part. It translates rotational movement to linear. A screw hole allows the belt to be tensioned after installation. 
 * Arm - a taller (by 2mm) shaker arm is provided to avoid collisions.
